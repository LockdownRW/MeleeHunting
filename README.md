# MeleeHunting

Removes all the pesky weapon restrictions imposed on hunting jobs in Alpha 15. Use swords, clubs, wood logs, bare fists, you name it. If your colonists are in any shape to fight, then they can hunt. 

Colonists without any equipped weapon or scyther blade will still generate a warning notification when set to hunt, but it's there purely for informative purposes, it won't stop you from punching squirrels to death if that's what you want.
